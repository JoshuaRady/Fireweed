#Description:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file is part of the Fireweed fire code library.  It contains R implementations of the
#Rothermel fire spread model (Rothermel 1972) with the modifications of Albini (Albini 1972).
#
# The Rothermel/Albini equations have been implemented in a form as close to the originals as was
#possible.  The modifications of Albini 1972 are considered official parts of the Rothermel fire
#spread model and all equations include these modifications where they apply.  The Rothermel model
#consists of a nested set of equations. The library presents functions for each equation with useful
#output.  Some functions are very simple and could be inlined but a focus on clarity and modularity
#have been prioritized over compactness.
#
# This code was started in Proj_11_Exp_3_Analysis_D5.r from Project 11 Experiment 3.

# This review summarizes and contextualizes the equations of Rothermel and Albini as well as
#related work and was an important reference for preparing this code.
#
#Notation:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The equations contain mathematical notation and variables with characters that cannot be directly
#represented in R/C++.  To represent the variables the following translations were used.
#
#Greek letters in variable names:
# Many variables use Greek characters.  In most cases these are translated using their English names
#with the case indicating the case of the character, e.g. β -> Beta and σ -> sigma.  In a few cases
#Greek variable names have been changed to abbreviations or descriptive names.  Greek is used when
#the original equaitons are shown in the comments.
#[See table of variables below.]
#
#Subscripts:
# Variables with subscripts are represented with underscores, e.g. Ab (A sub b) -> A_b.  A number of
#variables have two levels of subscript, the second representing fuel type indexes (i and j, see
#fuel classes below).  These are represented with underscores as well, e.g (Ab)ij ((A sub b) sub ij)
#-> A_b_ij.
#
#Diacritical marks:
# In Rothermel 1972 some variables for the heterogeneous fuels equations are marked with either
#bars to indicate a mean (across all fuel classes) or tildes for characteristic values of a fuel
#category (live/dead).  Most reprints ignore these.  We have left them out in most cases although
#a coulde variables of form x_bar are used.
#

        #(wo)ij ((w sub o) sub ij) = w_o_ij Array of oven dry fuel load for each fuel class (lb/ft^2).
#
#
#Variable notes:
# - The surface-area-to-volume ratio for fuels is notated as σ (sigma) and abbreviated as sav or
#SAV in different places in the papers.  We use SAV in the code.
# - It is unclear if fuel loading is w0 or wo.  In Rothermel 1972 it is not clear and in reprints it
#varies.  We use w sub o (w_o).
# - Total mineral content is occasionally notated S sub t rather than S sub T (e.g. Rothermel
#1972, pg. 36, Table 1).  We use S sub T (S_T).
#
#Fuel classes:
# For heterogeneous fuels fuel types are distinguished with subscripts i = 1 to m categories
#(live vs. dead) and j = 1 to n fuel size classes.  j = 1 for dead fuels and j = 2 for live fuels.
#All the standard fuels have three dead fuel size classes and two live classes (herbaceous vs.
#woody).  Therefore storiing fuel class properties in a matrix / 2D array would result in an
#empty/undefined postion in the live row.  We avoid this by representing fuel properties in the code
#as vectors.  Dead and live size classes are stored contiguously and we maintain a liveDead vector
#that holds the live/dead status for each vector index.  Where the original paper operations operate
#over indexes i and j we use index k, where k = 1 - (n + m), consistently to iterate over all
#positions.
#
#Units:
# The original equations used English units.  Units are indicated for function inputs and outputs.
#SI units will be added later.

#Therefore units convert: ft^2/ft^3 * cmPerFt^2/cmPerFt^2 = 1/ft * 1/cmPerFt = 1/cm

#Spread Rate Calculations:--------------------------------------------------------------------------

#Albini 1976 modified Rothermel spread model [for homogeneous fuels]:
#  Calculate the steady state spread rate for surface fuels and environmental conditions passed in.
#
#Input variables / parameters:
#  There are 11 input variables in total (see Andrews 2018 table 11), 4 fuel particle
#characteristics, 4 fuel array characteristics, and three environmental.
#
#Fuel particle properties: 
#h = heat content of the fuel class (Btu/lb | kJ/kg).
#  All the 53 standard fuel models use 8,000 Btu/lb.
#ST (S sub T) = Total mineral content (fuel particle property: mineral mass / total dry mass,
#  unitless fraction).  For all standard fuel models this is 5.55% (0.0555).
#Se (S sub e) = effective mineral content (fuel particle property: (mass minerals – mass silica) /
#  total dry mass, unitless fraction).  For all standard fuel models this is 1% (0.01).
#ρp (rho sub p) = fuel particle density (lb/ft^3 | kg/m^3)
#  All the 53 standard fuel models use 32 lb/ft^3.
#
#Fuel array:
#σ / SAV = characteristic surface-area-to-volume ratio (ft^2/ft^3 or cm^2/cm^3)
#w_o (w sub o) = Oven dry fuel load (lb/ft^2 | kg/m^2).  This includes combustible and mineral
#fractions.
#     Sometimes expressed as ton/acre (move to central documentation?).
#δ (delta) = fuel bed depth (ft | m)
#Mx (M sub x) = Moisture of extinction (fraction, water weight/dry fuel weight)
#
#Environmental:
#Mf (M sub f) = Fuel moisture content (water weight/dry fuel weight)
#U = wind speed at midflame height (ft/min | m/min)
#tan ϕ = slope steepness, maximum (fraction: vertical rise / horizontal distance, unitless)
#  [For many applications this will need to be converted from degrees.]
#
#useWindLimit = Use the wind limit calculation or not.

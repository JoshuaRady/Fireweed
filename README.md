# Fireweed
This project contains the Fireweed fire code library.  The library provides implementations of fire behavior model equations from the fire literature.  This is part of the Fireweed project to update the fire implementation in DVM-DOS-TEM.  The purpose of the library is to allow flexible code testing and exploration.  Expect this code to change rapidly.  The primary documentation will be comments in the code itself for now.

## R Code
The R code is an informal library.  It is source-able but it not structured as a R package and there is no plan make it into one at this time.  Rather the code is written will minimal R dependancies with the goal of making code that will be easily ported to C++.

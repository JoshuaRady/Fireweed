#Calculate the saturation vapor pressure of water vapor using the Tetens equation:
#
#The Tetens equation is the Magnus equation form with different parameters.  I have not be able to
#obtain the original German language manuscript (Otto Tetans 1930).  This function is based on that
#presented in Murray 1967.
#
#Note that this calculation is for pure water vapor.  The difference from moist air is small but not
#negligible.
#
#Parameters:
#tempC = The air temperature (degrees Celsius).
#
#Returns: The saturation vapor pressure of water vapor, P_s or e_s (hPa = millibar).
SaturationVaporPressureTetens <- function(tempC)
{
  #The formulation in Murray 1967 is:
  #e_s = 6.1078 * exp(a x (T - 273.16) / (T - b))
  #Where T is temperature in Kelvin and a and b are parameters that vary for e_s over ice and water.
  #The equations below are rearranged to take temperature in degrees Celsius.

#Calculate the saturation vapor pressure of water in moist air using the Arden Buck equation:
#
#The Arden Buck equation (Buck 1981) gives more accurate estimates of saturation vapor pressure than
#many earlier equations and includes an "enhancement factor" that adjusts the output to that of
#moist air.  This function incorporates improvements from Buck 1996.
#
#Parameters:
#tempC = The air temperature (degrees Celsius).
#p_hPa = (Atmospheric) pressure (hPa).  Defaults to typical air pressure at sea level.
#  This is used for the enhangment factor calculation,
#
#Returns: The saturation vapor pressure of water in moist air, P_s or e' sub s (hPa = millibars).
#
#p_hPa could be made optional.  If p_hPa was null the enhancement factor would not be applied and
#saturation vapor pressure of water vapor would be returned.

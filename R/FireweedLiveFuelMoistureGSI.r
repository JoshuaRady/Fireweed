#Description:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  This file is part of the Fireweed wildfire code library.  It contains an implementation of the
#GSI live fuel moisture model used in the National Danger Rating System (NFDRS) 2016.
#
#  Growing Season Index (GSI) is a index that can be used to predict phenological stage, such as
#greenup and greendown globally.  It is calculated from daily weather conditions and during the
#growing season its value can be viewed as a predictor of moisture content in plants that respond
#quickly to environmental conditions.  NFDRS uses GSI as a basis for prediction of live fuel
#moisture.
#  GSI, as well as herbaceous, and woody live fuel moisture are calculated daily but these values
#should not be used directly.  GSI values can change quickly with daily weather and plants should
#not be expected to respond as quickly.  Therefore the standard procedure is to a 21 day running
#average.  The authors also suggest that using monthly mean values as inputs may also provide an
#appropriate smoothing.

#Calculate the Growing Season Index for a location based on daily weather conditions:
#
#Parameters:
#tempCMin = Minimum daily temperature (degrees Celsius).
#vpdPa = Mean daily vapor pressure (VPD) deficit (Pa).  The documentation mentions maximum daily VPD
#  (VPD_max, not to be confused with the VPD_max parameter in the calculation) can also be used but
#  it is unclear if there are any changes in the calculation in this case.
#dayLength = Daylight length or photoperiod (seconds).
#
#Returns: The Growing Season Index (GSI) ranging from 0 (inactive) - 1 (unconstrained) (unitless).

  #Model parameters defining the range over with plants go from phenologially inactive to
  #unconstrained. 
  #These could be made into function default parameters.  While these are the standard values used
  #in all published work they could in theory be used to turn the model for specific conditions.

  #For temperatures any value above 0K is valid, but this doesn't seem like a very useful check.
  #We could check that the value is in a likely range.
  #VPD reaches ~10,000 Pa at 46C and 0% RH at sea level.  That is extremely high so this may not
  #catch much, especially since we use Pa.  Using the wrong units will likely decrease the value

#fuelModelFilePath = The path to the tab delimited file containing the table of fuel models.
#modelID = The standard fuel model number, alphanumeric code, or index of the model requested.  If
#  a number is passed and does not match a known model number it is interpreted as an index, that is
#  the position in the table of fuel models.  For 'the 13' the number, code, and index are the same.

#Find a fuel model in the specified file and return it as a fuel model object (list).

#Find a fuel model in the data frame passed return it as a fuel model object (list).
#
#Parameters:
#fuelModelDF = A data frame containing the table of fuel models.
#modelID = The standard fuel model number, alphanumeric code, or index of the model requested.  If
#  a number is passed and does not match a known model number it is interpreted as an index, that is
#  the position in the table of fuel models.  For 'the 13' the number, code, and index are the same.
#spreadModelUnits= If true then convert units used in the file that differ from those used in the
#  Rothermel & Albini spread model.
#
#ToDo:
# - The function assumes the input data is in its original English units if spreadModelUnits is true
#  but there handling for when this is false or is missing.  We could add an inputUnits parameter
#  to allow the input file to be in metric or alter the parameter behavior.
# - There is a question of whether to add M_f / M_f_ij to the data structure.
#
#Note: This expects draft 3 (D3) of the standard fuel models spreadsheet (loaded to a data frame).
#Note: This code currently assumes the units of the file are in United States customary units with
#loadings in ton/acre and moisture of extinction in percent.

#Take a dynamic fuel model and calculate and apply the curing of herbaceous fuels based on the
#herbaceous fuel moisture (per Scott & Burgan 2005).  For dynamic fuels curing moves some live
#herbaceous fuel to a new dead herbaceous fuel class. As a result the number of fuel classes may
#increase with this call.  The function takes a fuel model object and returns a modified version of
#it reflecting the curing process.
#  Trying to apply curing to a static fuel model has no effect except to store the moisture values.
#By default the code posts a warning when this occurs.
#
#Parameters:
#fm = The fuel model to apply curing to.
#M_f_ij = Fuel moisture content for for each fuel type (fraction: water weight/dry fuel weight).
#  If omitted curing must be specified.
#curing = The percent herbaceous fuel curing to apply.  This is provided as an alternative to
#  specifying moisture content.  Curing is normally calculated based on the live herbaceous fuel
#  moisture but it can be useful to specify the curing directly, especially for testing.
#warn = If true warn about attempts to apply curing to static models.
#
#Notes:
#  On return Curing and possibly M_f_ij elements will be added to the fuel model (fm).  It may be
#better to add these on initialization of the model.  However in that case both will be undefined
#initially.  M_f_ij will be remain undefined for static fuel models or until it is set for dynamic
#fuel models.  With this implementation Curing and M_f_ij don't exist until this function is called.
#
#  This implementation results in different weights for missing fuels that those published in
#Andrews 2018, but this does not have material effects.
#  If created the dead herbaceous fuel is inserted at the second position (1,2).  For the standard
#fuel model this results in dead fuels being in descending SAV order with the exception of SH9.

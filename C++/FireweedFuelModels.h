behavior fuel object for use with the Rothermel Albini (Rothermel 1972, Albini 1976) fire spread
model and related models.

/* @class FuelModel
 * @brief This class represents the fuel properties and quantities for a fuel bed.
 * 
 * FuelModel objects are used to hold and manipulate fire behavior fuel models for use with the
 * Rothermel Albini fire spread model.
 * 
 * Similar fuel models are used for other purposes such as fire danger.  This class could be
 * expanded in the future for those applications.
 *
 * @par Number of Fuel Types:
 *   The Rothermel Albini fire spread model includes calculations for homogenous (single fuel) and
 * heterogenous (multiple fuel) cases.  The standard fuel models have five fuel types and this
 * convention is commonly used for other related US models.  The number of fuel types is not fixed
 * and the number can vary in practice.
 *
 * @par
 *   Additionally, the number of fuel types in a fuel model may not represent the actual number of
 * fuel types.  For example some of the standard fuel models, 1 and 3 from the original 13, are in
 * fact homogenous.  In published tables they are presented with empty columns.  Other fuel models
 * leave some fuel columns empty as well.
 *
 * @par
 * Further, application of curing for dynamic fuel models introduces a sixth dead herbaceous fuel
 * class (assuming the five standard staring classes).
 *
 * @par
 * Our fuel model implementation allows for an arbitrary number of fuel types.
 *
 * @par Homogeneous Fuels:
 * The homogeneous fuels case can be represented as a FuelModel object with a single fuel class.
 * Such a fuel model can be fed into the homogeneous versions of the spread model equations.  A
 * complicating factor is the fact that the homogenous fuels version of the spread rate calculation
 * use slightly different, unsubscripted notation than the heterogenous versions.
 *
 * @par
 * Attempts were made to include both notations in the FuelModel object with some problems.  For
 * convenience homogeneous notation aliases are provided for the moisture of extinction and fuel
 * particle properties.  Aliases were used to prevent homogenous and heterogenous members from
 * getting out of sync.  These aliases turned out to be a problem because they can't be updated when
 * the heterogeneous members are resized.  This is a ubiquitous problem because currently the
 * members start empty and so have to be resized during initialization.
 *
 * @par
 * The homogeneous members remain pending revision but should not be used.  If we can't find a way
 * to make them work they could be replaced with getter functions.
 *
 * @par Fuel Moisture:
 * Since fuel moisture is highly dynamic it is not included in fuel model tables and traditionally
 * may not be treated as part of a fuel model itself.  We have made the choice to optionally allow
 * fuel moisture to be recorded in the FuelModel object.  There are several reasons for this.  First
 * is is convient to keep all the fuel properties together.  More importantly the fuel moisture
 * values are linked with number and types of fuels.  Adding them to the fuel model allows us to
 * check them and make sure they are valid and consistent the fuels.  Finally, and perhaps most
 * importantly, this was necessary to represent dynamic fuel model behavior since calculating dynamic
 * fuel model moisture changes the structure of the fuel model itself.
 *
 * @par
 * The fuel moisture representation is currently focused on heterogeneous fuel moisture.  The
 * homogeneous case is less essential since M_f is a single value that is static.  It may be added
 * in the future.
 *
 * @par Fuel Model Properties:
 * For more information on fuel model data members see the documentation in FireweedRAFireSpread.cpp.
 * Add more here!!!!! ...

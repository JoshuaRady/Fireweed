/** Calculate the saturation vapor pressure of water vapor using the Tetens equation:
 * 
 * The Tetens equation is the Magnus equation form with different parameters.  I have not be able to
 * obtain the original German language manuscript (Otto Tetans 1930).  This function is based on that
 * presented in Murray 1967.
 * 
 * Note that this calculation is for pure water vapor.  The difference from moist air is small but not
 * negligible.
 * 
 * @param tempC The air temperature (degrees Celsius).
 * 
 * @returns: The saturation vapor pressure of water vapor, P_s, P_sat, vp_sat, or e_s (hPa = millibar).
